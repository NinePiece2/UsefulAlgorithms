## Introduction

 This repository contains some useful algorithms completed in Java. Each project folder is used to sort the algorithms to make finding them easier. Most of the algorithms take input from a text file and some take input directly from the command line. The projects were created in Eclipse using JDK 19.

## List of Algorithms

The Algorithms are given as a single java project where each package is a different type of Algorithm, and each package has its own Driver that runs all of the classes in the package for simplicity. The input is taken from text files other than for Substring Search Algorithms where the input is taken by user console input.
