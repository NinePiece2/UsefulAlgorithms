# Useful Algorithms

## Introduction

 This repository contains some useful algorithms completed in Java. Each project folder is used to sort the algorithms to make finding them easier. Most of the algorithms take input from a text file and some take input directly from the command line. The projects were created in Eclipse using JDK 19.
